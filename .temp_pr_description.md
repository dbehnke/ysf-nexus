TL;DR

This PR collects fixes and improvements for OpenSpot status probe handling, logging, repeater arbitration, and CI hardening. It makes the project safer to run in CI and more robust at runtime.

## What changed in this PR

- Fix OpenSpot compatibility: properly accept and parse 4-byte YSFS probes (see network/repeater fixes).
- Repeater/muting: improved single-active-stream arbitration and muting behavior to avoid double-talk and stuck mutes.
- Logging: consolidated and clarified logging for status updates and errors.
- Config validation: added validation for `server.talk_max_duration` (must be > 0) and `server.unmute_after` (must be >= 0) to prevent invalid runtime settings.
- CI: replaced an unsafe Dagger installer step that executed remote scripts with a pinned release download and added idempotent extraction into a temp dir. Fixed `dagger-ci.yml` to extract the tarball into a temporary directory before moving the binary (resolves tar conflict).
- Docs: updated `CLAUDE.md`, `COPILOT.md`, and `README.md` with Dagger CI context and current project status.

## CI status (as of update)

- Go tests: passing
- golangci-lint: passing
- govulncheck: passing
- Dagger CI: passing (fixed install step; pipeline completed successfully)

## How I verified

- Ran `go test ./... --short` locally and via Dagger CI â€” relevant packages pass.
- Inspected GitHub Actions logs to confirm the Dagger installer now verifies the tarball checksum and extracts into a temporary directory.
- Pushed fixes and observed subsequent Dagger CI runs complete successfully.

If you'd like, I can merge this PR now that CI is green, or I can remove the now-manual GitHub Actions workflows or update branch protection to point to the Dagger CI check. Let me know which action you'd prefer.
