# YSF Reflector Go Implementation Project

## Project Overview
Convert the C++ YSF (Yaesu System Fusion) Reflector from https://github.com/nostar/DVReflectors/tree/main/YSFReflector to a modern Go application with enhanced features for amateur radio digital voice communication.

## Goals
- **High Concurrency**: Handle ~200 simultaneous connections using Go's goroutines
- **Easy Deployment**: Single binary with Docker support
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit and integration tests
- **Web Dashboard**: Self-contained web interface for monitoring
- **Bridge Functionality**: Scheduled connections to other YSF reflectors
- **MQTT Integration**: Real-time events for external systems
- **Monolithic Binary**: All features in one executable

## YSF Protocol Analysis
Based on the original C++ implementation:

### Core Protocol Features
- **Transport**: UDP networking (IPv4/IPv6)
- **Packet Types**:
  - `YSFP`: Poll/Registration packets
  - `YSFU`: Unlink packets
  - `YSFD`: Data transmission (155 bytes)
  - `YSFS`: Status packets (hash, name, description, count)
- **Connection Management**: Dynamic repeater add/remove with timeouts
- **Data Flow**: Packet routing between connected repeaters

### Current C++ Architecture Limitations
- Single-threaded event loop
- Sequential I/O processing
- Limited monitoring capabilities
- No web interface
- No bridging functionality

## Go Application Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Network Layer (`pkg/network/`)
```go
type UDPServer struct {
    conn        *net.UDPConn
    handlers    map[string]PacketHandler
    metrics     *Metrics
}

type Packet struct {
    Type    string
    Data    []byte
    Addr    *net.UDPAddr
    Timestamp time.Time
}
```

#### 2. Repeater Management (`pkg/repeater/`)
```go
type Manager struct {
    repeaters   sync.Map              // thread-safe repeater storage
    timeout     time.Duration
    blocklist   *BlockList
    events      chan Event
}

type Repeater struct {
    Callsign    string
    Address     *net.UDPAddr
    LastSeen    time.Time
    Connected   time.Time
    TalkStart   *time.Time
    PacketCount uint64
}
```

#### 3. Web Dashboard (`pkg/web/`)
```go
type Dashboard struct {
    server      *http.Server
    templates   *template.Template
    api         *API
    websocket   *WebSocketHub
}
```

#### 4. Bridge System (`pkg/bridge/`)
```go
type Bridge struct {
    scheduler   *cron.Cron
    connections map[string]*BridgeConnection
    config      *BridgeConfig
}
```

#### 5. MQTT Client (`pkg/mqtt/`)
```go
type Client struct {
    client   mqtt.Client
    events   <-chan Event
    config   *Config
}

type Event struct {
    Type      string    `json:"type"`
    Callsign  string    `json:"callsign"`
    Timestamp time.Time `json:"timestamp"`
    Duration  *time.Duration `json:"duration,omitempty"`
}
```

### Concurrency Design
- **Main UDP Listener**: Single goroutine for packet reception
- **Packet Processors**: Worker pool for packet handling
- **Repeater Timeout**: Background goroutine for cleanup
- **Bridge Connections**: Individual goroutines per bridge
- **Web Server**: Standard Go HTTP server with goroutines
- **MQTT Publisher**: Dedicated goroutine for event publishing

## CI/CD Pipeline with Dagger

### Overview
The project uses Dagger Go SDK for containerized, reproducible CI/CD pipelines that run identically in local development and GitHub Actions.

### Dagger Implementation
- **Location**: `dagger/main.go` - Complete Go SDK implementation
- **Configuration**: `dagger.json` - Dagger engine v0.18.19 with Go SDK
- **Container Base**: `golang:1.25` for consistent build environment

### Available Dagger Functions

#### Core Functions
```bash
# Test - Run all Go tests with dependency management
dagger call test --source=.

# Lint - Run comprehensive golangci-lint checks
dagger call lint --source=.

# Vuln - Security vulnerability scanning with govulncheck
dagger call vuln --source=.

# Build - Create optimized Linux binary
dagger call build --source=.

# CI - Complete pipeline (test + lint + vuln)
dagger call ci --source=.
```

#### Pipeline Components
1. **Base Container**: Sets up Go 1.25 environment with source code
2. **Test Suite**: Runs unit tests for all packages (config, network, reflector, repeater)
3. **Linting**: golangci-lint with comprehensive rule set (0 issues required)
4. **Vulnerability Scanning**: govulncheck for security analysis
5. **Binary Build**: Cross-compiled Linux executable

### Local Development Workflow
```bash
# Validate changes locally (matches CI exactly)
dagger call ci --source=.

# Run individual steps for faster feedback
dagger call test --source=.
dagger call lint --source=.

# Build and test binary locally
dagger call build --source=. export --path=./ysf-nexus-linux
```

### GitHub Actions Integration
- **Workflow**: `.github/workflows/dagger-ci.yml`
- **Trigger**: Push to any branch, pull requests
- **Command**: `dagger call ci --source=.`
- **Duration**: ~2 minutes for complete pipeline
- **Status**: ✅ All runs passing successfully

### Benefits of Dagger Approach
- **Reproducibility**: Same container environment locally and in CI
- **Speed**: Intelligent caching and parallelization
- **Developer Experience**: `dagger call` locally matches CI exactly
- **Maintainability**: Go code instead of shell scripts
- **Portability**: Works on any Dagger-supported platform

### CI Pipeline Results (Latest)
```
✅ Tests: All packages pass (config, network, reflector, repeater)
✅ Linting: 0 issues found with golangci-lint
✅ Security: No vulnerabilities detected
✅ Build: Linux binary created successfully
⏱️ Total time: ~2 minutes
```

This containerized CI approach ensures that the YSF Nexus project maintains high code quality and security standards while providing fast developer feedback loops.
